<h2> Multiple Intelligence Test </h2> 

<p> My top intelligences are Kinaesthetic and Naturalist </p>
<body>
    <img src="multiintel.png" width="400" height="200">
    </body>
</html>

<h2> What do the results of these tests mean for you? </h2>

<p> These test results mean I like to sense and feel whilst gaining experiences through hands on work to remember the procedure. Through the online Myers-Briggs test, I am spontaneous and enjoy learning off others around me and enjoy always being around others. In the learning test, the results confirmed I enjoy visualising what I am learning predominantly, followed by experiencing others carrying out the specific action and hearing the instructions of those actions so I am able to mimic and produce the same outcome. Lastly, in the 3rd test, Kinaesthetic learning was the dominant learning style, aligning with Naturalist learning styles and thirdly musical styles which all aid my learning and bolster my ability to retain information. </p>

</body>
</html>

<h2> How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </h2>

<p> These results may influence behaviour in team environments both positively and negatively. The positive side of these learning behaviours are that I am quick to learn new activities and processes, and I am outgoing and comfortable to adapt to new individuals in a team or a different collective. This would mean I would be able to learn off individuals through experiencing the process of creating an object and then would be able to mimic that action to achieve a similar outcome. I would be required to gather a feel and perceive the task ahead before commencing and engaging with the task. Furthermore, I am lower on a logical scale and therefore would have to compromise to adjust with logical thinkers, therefore if paired with logical thinkers, I would be able to identify their thinking patterns through experiencing them achieve a common goal and following those set actions to achieve the same goal. On the other hand, a negative of my learning traits are that I would have to visualise others demonstrating a task beforehand and then engaging in the activity to ensure I am following the correct process, consequently this is consuming time as I would be required to follow instructions before commencing, as I would feel the exercise or task beforehand. </p>

</body>
</html>

<h2> How should you take this into account when forming a team? </h2>

<p> Whilst forming a team, I would consider working with those who are able to visualise a task before hand and learn through discussion, as opposed to learning through traditional book learning methods. Finding individuals whom enjoy experiencing the work and viewing demonstrations would be fitted to my learning styles. Finding an individual who was adept in the designated task would be accommodating as the rest of the group would be able to take time to visualise and engage with hands on attempts at completing the tasks. However, as the Myer-Briggs test demonstrated, in the circumstances I were too form a team with others from alternative learning traits, I am able to adjust and adapt to others and am comfortable communicating to the rest of the team if I felt I was lacking understanding of the desired goal, therefore through reaching for assistance I would be able to gather a feel for the task ahead. </p>

<h1> Project Idea (Race!Race!Race!Australia) </h1>

<h2> Overview </h2> 

<p> The project idea will be a car racing game where you can race automobiles of your selection. As many racing games currently don’t feature Australian specific maps, this race car game will demonstrate Australian based racetracks through capital cities and other Australian iconic venues, which have been developed into a racing circuit. The game will be formatted and created through the game development engine known as Unity. The reason for utilising Unity whilst developing the project is due to its multiplayer features. The game will allow multiple players to verse each other on Australian race tracks, with different levels to allow the players to develop better driving traits and racing accessories. </p>

</body>
</html>

<h2> Motivation </h2>

<p> The purpose behind developing an Australian based racing game is due to the lack of choice in the gaming markets when it comes to Australian racing games. Australian’s heavily rely on Cars as a mode of transport with 17.6 million vehicles registered in Australia in 2014 and each Australian is estimated to travel 15,500km each year in their vehicles (Australian Academy of Science 2017). Therefore, Australia is a huge market for individuals whom use cars. Recently, there has been an escalating issue of individuals speeding and breaching motor laws, resulting in serious accidents, injuries and unfortunately numerous deaths. This project will seek to create a safe, multiplier environment with familiar landmarks to safely compete with others in motor racing formats. </p>

</body>
</html>

<h2> Description </h2>

<p>  The game will offer players multiple driving circuits to race against friends through a multiplayer service. The game will host 3 iconic maps through the streets of Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, where players can choose to create their own vehicle, or choose an already underpowered vehicle. The game will allow up to 3 players at once to play on the same multiplier server and points are awarded to the player who wins the race, the player who places second and the player who places last. The number of points awarded are based on the players polling positions. 1st place will be awarded 100 points, 2nd place will be awarded 50 points, and last place will be awarded with 25 points. After the race has been completed players are able to return to a main menu, and then possess the ability to enter an inventory (garage), where they’re able to customise their vehicle and create a more powerful engine, in addition to buying new colours, body kits, tyres and rims for their vehicle of choice. Additional services will offer players the choice to play against computer stimulated robots if they choose to play offline or do not have the ability to connect to the internet. Online features will require multiplayer seeking individuals to create an account, which will enable the game to recognise the players statistics and vehicles of choice. The game will also hold the function for players to see their racing record, where they can view their wins and losses, in addition to their favourite track of choice. The game will load these tracks of choice at random through numbers of votes between the 3 online players, majority of votes will select the circuit of choice. The Brisbane map will run in a circuit starting from George street, left down Alice street, and left down Edward Street (Google Maps 2019). Furthermore, players will have to drive right down Eagle Street and continue onto Wharf Street (Google Maps 2019). Lastly, the straight will be down Adelaide Street (Google Maps 2019). The river and notable buildings of Brisbane will be attempted to be created through the game. The Melbourne Map will start the circuit on Flinders Street, before turning right onto St Kilda road past federation square and the Yarra River, and then will be ending near the State Gallery of Victoria, the map will embrace curves in the road and any tram track movement to enable bends for players to overtake each other (Google Maps 2019). The Sydney map will start on Hickson Road Eastbound, under the Sydney Harbour Bridge and then a sharp left onto George Street. From there players will turn left onto Lower Fort Street and right onto Windmill street where the race will come to a completion (Google Maps 2019). The number of laps in the game will be selected by the 3 players before race commencements begin, majority of votes will select the map of the race. The camera view of the car racing game will be from slightly above the driver’s car. The car will also become slower if crashed or bumped.</p>


</body>
</html>

<h2> Tools and Technologies </h2>

<p> The software needed to build the racing car program will be Unity 3D, and the cars will be moved by ‘transform’ and ‘up-date’ functions that allow the frame to move. The coding language which will be utilised to allow the features of the car racing game to work will be JavaScript code. To allow the maps to be created with features of each city, google maps will be significantly depended upon to map out the circuit, with street view playing a predominant role so the player feels as though they are driving through the streets of their selected city. Furthermore, the code will be hosted on GitHub to manage the code. </p>

</body>
</html>

<h2> Skills Required </h2>

<p> The skills which are required to build the product are knowledge of the JavaScript language, knowledge of how to build a game server in Unity and knowledge of the internet. This could take months to become advance at JavaScript as the specific language is difficult. To create a complex and multiplayer game, this may take between 1-3 years to complete and therefore may be quite time consuming. The required hardware applicable to develop a game on Unity will be a larger video RAM over 2GB, a powerful CPU and dual monitor set ups to expand the screen space to allow for a larger visual whilst completing the development of the game (Iwaniuk 2018). Additional hardware which would be useful whilst developing the program would be an Intel Core i5 processor and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card to enhance the visuals of the program (Iwaniuk, 2018). </p>

</body>
</html>

<h2> Outcome </h2>

<p> If the project turns out a success, the game will feature 3 iconic Australian racing circuits in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne, allowing players of all ages to race in their own customised vehicles or pre-built generic vehicles. The program will run with no glitches or issues, and players will be able to choose which map they commence racing on through majority of votes in the party. The goal of this application is to allow drivers to enjoy familiar streets to safely race upon in an attempt to decrease the number of individuals who currently drive recklessly on the streets. The social impact will be positive through reducing the number of injuries and deaths in the streets of Australia, encouraging those to race in Australian streets in a safe environment. </p>
